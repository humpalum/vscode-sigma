* Remote Desktop Settings: Limit Remote Desktop logons to authorized accounts to prevent misuse by adversaries.
* Dedicated Administrative Accounts: Create specialized domain-wide accounts that are restricted from interactive logons but can perform specific tasks like installations or repository access.
